 

# 🚗 Auto Insurance Data Analysis & Machine Learning Model  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project involves **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Machine Learning (ML) modeling** on an **auto insurance dataset**. The dataset includes customer demographics, insurance policies, claim history, and premium adjustments. Our goal is to gain insights into insurance customer behavior and build predictive models for decision-making.  

## 🔍 Key Steps  
### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- **Univariate Analysis:** Histograms, KDE plots, box plots, violin plots, and pie charts.  
- **Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis:** Scatter plots, correlation heatmaps, line plots, and pair plots.  

### 🧹 Data Preprocessing  
- **Outlier Detection & Removal:** Used IQR method to detect and remove anomalies.  
- **Label Encoding:** Converted categorical features into numerical format.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Created meaningful features for model improvement.  

### 🤖 Machine Learning Modeling  
- Built predictive models using:  
  - **Logistic Regression**  
  - **Random Forest**  
  - **XGBoost**  
  - **Neural Networks**  
- Performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.  

## 📁 Dataset Details  
The dataset includes the following key columns:  
- `Age` - Age of the insured individual.  
- `Marital_Status` - Single or married.  
- `Prior_Insurance` - Duration of previous insurance coverage.  
- `Claims_Frequency` - Number of claims made.  
- `Claims_Severity` - Severity level of past claims.  
- `Credit_Score` - Creditworthiness of the policyholder.  
- `Region` - Residential area (Urban, Suburban, etc.).  
- `Conversion_Status` - Whether the individual converted to a policyholder.
